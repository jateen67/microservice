# Distributed System

The purpose of this project was to build a scalable application using microservice architecture.

### What is microservice architecture?

Microservices architecture is a method of building large applications out of smaller, modular services or components. A given service can handle functionality like user authentication, alert generation, data logging, and a number of other functions. Each service handles its own database and typically runs a distinct process.

### How to run

1. Run `docker-compose up -d` in the root directory
2. `cd` into the `client` directory
3. Run `npm install`, followed by `npm run dev`
